# Science Review

## Work

**Work = what causes the object to move in the direction of force**

Requirements for work to be done:

- Object **has to move**
- Object has to **move in the same direction of force**

Unit for work: `Joule (J)`

> Formula for work:<br>`Work (J) = Force (N) * Distance (m)`<br>`W = Fd`

## Power

**Power = rate of [work](#work)**

Unit for power: `Watt (W)`

> Formula for power:<br>`Power (W) = Work (J) / Time (sec)`<br>`P = w/t`

## Simple Machines

- make [work](#work) easier
- have few or no moving parts

There are **6** simple machines.

- [Inclined plane](#inclined-plane)
- [Wheel & Axle](#wheel--axle)
- [Screw](#screw)
- [Wedge](#wedge)
- [Pulley](#pulley)
- [Lever](#lever)
  - Type 1
  - Type 2
  - Type 3

---

### Inclined plane

A slope or a ramp.<br>
Uses less force over a greater distance.

**Example**: Ramps

---

### Wheel & Axle

Consists of:

- A wheel
- An axle

A wheel is connected to a rod/axle at the center.<br>
It makes rotation easier, like door knobs.

**Example**: Bicycle wheels

---

### Screw

An [inclined plane](#inclined-plane) wrapped around a rod or cylinder.

**Example**: Screws, water bottle caps

---

### Wedge

An [inclined plane](#inclined-plane) on the sides.<br>
Used for cutting or splitting things.

**Example**: Axes

---

### Pulley

A rope to turn around the wheel.<br>
So, the load can be lifted with less force.

---

### Lever

Lifting or moving load with less force.

**There are 3 classes/types of levers**

- **Type 1 (First class)**

  - Scissors

- **Type 2 (Second class)**

  - Wheelbarrows
  - Bottle openers

- **Type 3 (Third class)**
  - Shovels
  - Tweezers

## Energy

**Energy = ability to do [work](#work)**

**All living things** need energy to work.

### Forms of energy

- [**Stored energy**](#stored-energy)
  - Potential
    - Gravitational
    - Elastic
  - Nuclear
  - Chemical

- [**Working energy**](#working-energy)
  - Kinetic
  - Heat
  - Electrical
  - Radiant (light)
  - Sound

**Stored energy = energy is stored and can be released when needed.**<br>
**Working energy = energy that involves work being done.**

---

### Stored energy

**Potential Energy** = energy that's stored in a body at rest.

- **Gravitational potential energy**

  - Result of object being elevated.
  - The higher the object is, it's more likely it is going to fall (higher gravitational potential energy), which is also affected by the object's weight.

- **Elastic potential energy**
  - energy stored in an elastic object like rubber bands or springs, are stretched.

---

**Chemical Energy**

- Stored in
  - Food
  - Fluids
  - Electric cells
- **Examples**:
  - Batteries

---

**Nuclear Energy**

- Stored in atom's nucleus
- Collected by radiation
- Released during nuclear reactions

---

### Working energy

**Kinetic Energy**

- Energy **in motion**
- Depending on the speed of movement
- Faster the object in motion, more kinetic energy

---

**Radiant/light Energy**

- From objects that emit light
- _property: **luminious**_

---

**Heat/Thermal Energy**

- Energy that flows from high to low temperature
- **comes from molecule's movement (the hotter, the faster they move)**
- More heat, higher temperature
- Less heat, lower temperature

---

**Electrical Energy**

- Movement of electrons flowing
- Consists of:
  - Static
  - Current

---

**Sound Energy**

- produced by vibrations

## Energy Transformations and Conservation

**Cycle of energy, or transformation** (conversion)<br>
Energy gets converted, it **doesn't get destroyed**

**Examples**:

- Speaker = electrical -> sound
- Solar panels = light -> electrical
